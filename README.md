<center> <h1>HBNB - The Console</h1> </center>

This repository represents the initial phase of a student project aimed at developing a replica of the AirBnB website. This phase focuses on implementing a backend interface, referred to as the console, which facilitates the management of program data. Through the console commands provided, users can perform operations such as creating, updating, and deleting objects, along with managing file storage. The system ensures persistence of data between sessions through JSON serialization and deserialization mechanisms.
